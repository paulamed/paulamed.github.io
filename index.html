    <p>A look into my current crochet project. I'm making a chapaa plushie from the video game Palia. Inspiration from and pattern from: https://www.etsy.com/shop/SewVixenDesigns </p>

      <p>
        Decided to pull out my embroidery threads and needles to make the face! The eyes and nose are made of wool felt.

      <p>
        Head and ears are completely done. The body section is mostly done. Still need to attach parts together.

      <h3>Chapaa head in the making</h3>
      <img src="images/beginning_head.jpg" alt="Picture progress of the making of the head." />
      <p>
        A start on the head of the chapaa! This is the biggest section of this project. It involves a lot of color changes.

      <h3>Picking colors </h3>
      <img src="images/color_selection.jpg" alt="My yarn selection for this project." />
      <p>
        I decided to stray away from the pattern a little bit. I'm using Demi Purl yarn by Loops & Threads in a size 6. My Chapaa plushie will be bigger than the pattern model plushie!
